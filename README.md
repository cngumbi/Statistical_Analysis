# R_Data_Statistics
bibliometrics
creating a bibliometrix analysis of the mikoko project 

we strat the project analysis by installing pacman
the code used to install pacman is
install.package("pacman")
pacman is the initials of package manager
this package is used to help you manage and install other package as you progess with your project
# How it is used
pacman::p_load(the packages to be loaded)
eg, pacman::p_load(pacman, bibliometrix, dplyr, GGally, ggplot2, ggthemes, ggvis,
               httr, lubridate, plotly, rio, rmarkdown, shiny, stringr, tidyr,
               grid, gridExtra, gapminder, tidyverse, frequency)
    to remove all the packages loaded use pacman::p_unload(all) to unload all the packges loadd
    to remove one or two packages use pacman::p_unload(the name of the package to be unloaded)
    eg pacman::p_uload(bibliometrix) or pacman::p_unload(frequency, shiny, anyother package to unload)
 # How to install packages in R
 To install a package in R studio use this code
 install.package("the name of package to be installed")
 eg. install.package("bibliometrix")
 
 # how to load the file in R studio 
 To load a manualy craeted bibliometrix  file in Rstudio us the following code
 X<-read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep = ",")
      X- this is the variable we've created to store the file
      read.csv()- this is a bluid i function that enables you to select a file with in your computer
      file.choose()-here it's used a an argument. it's a function that gives you the power to upload or choose a file from the desktop
      header-the header can be either us true or fulse 
      sep-this argumnt is used to specifies the fiie spabce type
      
 # To specify the length of the loaded data
 the code to be used is options(max.print=lenth of the file)
 eg. options( max.print = 10000000 ) for our file int depends with yur file.
